# SVD-Based-Watermarking-Schemes

This paper surveys techniques for digital image watermarking that employ singular value decomposition as a
method for embedding watermarks imperceptibly in images. Multiple desirable qualities of digital watermarks are
explained and their balance discussed. Three foundational papers are discussed in detail, implemented in Python,
and experiments on these methods are conducted. We find that simpler methods tend to have better performance
but at the cost of higher computational intensity. We discuss extensions to these schemes as well as practical
applications in areas from medicine to copyright protection.
